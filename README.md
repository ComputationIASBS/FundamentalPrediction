# Running the Code

To run the code for each approach:

1. **Navigate to the Respective Folder:** Go to the directory related to the specific method you want to run.

2. **Execute "main.py":** Run the "main.py" file within that folder.

   This will create a directory named "Results" where the program's output will be organized in each step.

After completing the execution of "main.py" for each method, you can visualize the final results of each method by running the **"generating_results_tables.ipynb"** file section by section using **Jupyter Notebook**.

Enjoy exploring the results!
