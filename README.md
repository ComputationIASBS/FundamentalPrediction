# Data

Within the repository's root directory, you will find a [Data](https://github.com/ComputationIASBS/FundamentalPrediction/tree/main/Data) folder housing a CSV file. Detailed descriptions for each of the columns can be found here.

1. **CompanyId:** The unique identifier for each company
2. **PersianYear:** Persian Calendar Year
3. **Return:**  "Return" in the context of finance and investment refers to the gain or loss made on an investment over a specific period, typically expressed as a percentage of the initial investment or capital. Returns are a fundamental concept in finance and are used to evaluate the performance and profitability of investments, including stocks, bonds, real estate, and other assets. There are various types of returns, each serving a specific purpose. In this context our mean is Total Return, Total return measures the overall gain or loss on an investment, considering all sources of return, including price appreciation (capital gains) and any income generated (such as dividends or interest). It is often expressed as a percentage of the initial investment or over a specific period.
4. **Beta:** Beta, often referred to as "Beta coefficient" or simply "Beta," is a financial metric used to measure the sensitivity of a stock's returns to changes in the overall market's returns. It is a fundamental concept in the field of finance and investment analysis, particularly in the context of portfolio management and risk assessment. A stock's Beta is calculated through statistical analysis, typically by regressing the historical returns of the stock against the returns of a relevant market index, such as the S&P 500.  
The formula for Beta is as follows:<br><br>
Beta = Covariance (Stock Returns, Market Returns) / Variance (Market Returns)<br>
In this formula:  
Covariance measures how the returns of the stock and the market move together or diverge from each other over time. A positive covariance indicates that the stock's returns tend to move in the same direction as the market's returns, while a negative covariance suggests they move in opposite directions. Variance measures the overall volatility (risk) of the market's returns.  
The interpretation of Beta values is as follows:<br><br>
A Beta of 1:  
If a stock has a Beta of 1, it means its returns tend to move in line with the market. If the market goes up by 1%, the stock, on average, is expected to go up by 1%, and if the market goes down by 1%, the stock is expected to go down by 1%.<br><br>
A Beta greater than 1:  
If a stock has a Beta greater than 1 (e.g., Beta of 1.2), it is considered more volatile than the market. It is expected to have larger price swings, both up and down, compared to the market.  
A Beta of 1.2 means that if the market goes up by 1%, the stock, on average, is expected to go up by 1.2%, and vice versa.<br><br>
A Beta less than 1:  
If a stock has a Beta less than 1 (e.g., Beta of 0.8), it is considered less volatile than the market. It is expected to have smaller price fluctuations compared to the market. A Beta of 0.8 means that if the market goes up by 1%, the stock, on average, is expected to go up by 0.8%, and vice versa.<br><br>
A Beta of 0:  
If a stock has a Beta of 0, it suggests that its returns are not correlated with the market's returns. This is relatively rare and implies that the stock's performance is driven by factors other than the broader market.<br><br>
A negative Beta:  
A negative Beta suggests that the stock's returns tend to move in the opposite direction of the market. For example, if the market goes up, a stock with a negative Beta may go down.<br><br>
Beta is a useful tool for investors to assess the risk and return potential of a stock within the context of the broader market. A Beta greater than 1 indicates higher volatility and potentially higher returns but also higher risk, while a Beta less than 1 indicates lower volatility and potentially lower returns but also lower risk. It helps investors make informed decisions about portfolio diversification and risk management.

5. **Debt_to_total_assets_ratio:** The "Debt to Total Assets Ratio" is a financial metric that assesses the proportion of a company's total assets that are financed by debt. It is a key indicator of a company's capital structure and financial leverage. The formula to calculate the Debt to Total Assets Ratio is as follows:  
Debt to Total Assets Ratio = (Total Debt / Total Assets) * 100 In this formula: Total Debt represents all of a company's outstanding debt, including both short-term and long-term debt obligations. It encompasses loans, bonds, and other forms of borrowing. Total Assets represent the company's total holdings, including cash, accounts receivable, inventory, property, plant, equipment, and other assets. The Debt to Total Assets Ratio is expressed as a percentage and provides insights into the company's financial risk and the extent to which it relies on debt to finance its operations and acquisitions. A higher ratio suggests a larger proportion of the company's assets are financed by debt, which may indicate higher financial risk due to interest payments and repayment obligations. Investors, creditors, and financial analysts use this ratio to assess a company's financial health and its risk profile. A lower ratio is generally considered more favorable, as it suggests a lower level of financial leverage and potentially less financial risk. However, the optimal Debt to Total Assets Ratio can vary by industry and company, and it's essential to consider industry norms and the company's specific circumstances when interpreting this metric.

6. **Operating_profit_to_sale:** The "Operating Profit to Sales" ratio, often referred to as the "Operating Profit Margin," is a financial metric that assesses the profitability of a company's core operating activities as a percentage of its total sales or revenue. It measures how efficiently a company is generating profit from its primary business operations, excluding non-operating income and expenses such as interest and taxes. The formula to calculate the Operating Profit to Sales ratio is as follows:  
Operating Profit Margin = (Operating Profit / Total Sales) * 100  
In this formula:  
Operating Profit represents the profit generated from a company's core operating activities, calculated by subtracting operating expenses (e.g., cost of goods sold, operating overhead) from total sales or revenue.  
Total Sales, also known as revenue, represents the total income generated from the company's primary business operations. The Operating Profit Margin is expressed as a percentage and provides insight into how effectively a company manages its operating costs and generates profit from its core business activities. A higher operating profit margin indicates that the company is efficient in controlling its operating expenses, resulting in higher profitability. Investors, analysts, and business managers use the Operating Profit Margin to assess a company's operational efficiency and profitability. It helps in evaluating a company's ability to cover its operating costs, make necessary investments, and generate profit from its primary operations. Comparing the operating profit margin to industry benchmarks or historical values can provide valuable insights into a company's financial health and competitiveness.

7. **Fixed_asset_turnover:** The fixed asset turnover, also known as fixed asset turnover ratio, is a financial metric that measures how efficiently a company is using its fixed assets (such as buildings, machinery, equipment) to generate sales or revenue. It is calculated by dividing the company's net sales or revenue by its average fixed assets. This ratio indicates how effectively a company is deploying its fixed assets to generate income. A higher fixed asset turnover ratio generally implies better asset utilization and operational efficiency.

8. **Return_from_market:** "Return from the market" typically refers to the profits or gains obtained from investments made in the financial markets, such as stocks, bonds, or other securities. This return is a measure of how well an investment has performed and is usually expressed as a percentage or a monetary amount. It reflects the increase (positive return) or decrease (negative return) in the value of an investment over a specific period (in this context Yearly return of TEDPIX), taking into account factors like capital appreciation, dividends, or interest earned.

9. **Current_assets_ratio:** The "current assets ratio" is a financial ratio that measures a company's ability to cover its short-term liabilities with its current assets. It is calculated by dividing the total current assets by the total current liabilities. This ratio provides insight into a company's liquidity and its capacity to meet its short-term financial obligations. A higher current assets ratio indicates a stronger ability to pay off short-term debts and suggests a more financially stable position.

10. **Working_capital_return:** "Working capital return" typically refers to the return or profit generated from the working capital of a business. Working capital is the difference between a company's current assets (e.g., cash, accounts receivable, inventory) and its current liabilities (e.g., accounts payable, short-term debt). The return on working capital measures how effectively a company is utilizing its short-term assets and liabilities to generate profits. It is not a standard financial ratio but rather a concept that can be evaluated in the context of a specific business or investment strategy.

11. **Longterm_debt_to_equity_ratio:** The "long-term debt to equity ratio" is a financial metric that assesses a company's financial leverage or solvency by comparing its long-term debt (such as loans, bonds, or other obligations with maturities exceeding one year) to its shareholders' equity. It is calculated by dividing long-term debt by shareholders' equity. This ratio provides insight into how much of a company's capital structure is financed through long-term debt as opposed to equity. A high long-term debt to equity ratio can indicate that a company has a significant amount of debt relative to its equity, which may imply higher financial risk. Conversely, a lower ratio suggests a more conservative capital structure with a greater reliance on equity financing. It's an important metric for investors and creditors to assess a company's financial health and risk profile.

12. **Return_ratio_without_risk:** The "return ratio without risk" typically refers to the measure of investment returns or profits achieved without considering or factoring in the associated risk. In finance, such a return is often referred to as the "nominal return" or "gross return." It represents the percentage increase in an investment's value or the profit earned from an investment without adjusting for the level of risk involved.  
It's essential to note that in practice, all investments carry some level of risk, and calculating the actual or realized return often takes into account factors like volatility, market fluctuations, and the potential for loss. Therefore, while a nominal return may provide an initial assessment of an investment's performance, it's crucial to consider risk-adjusted measures like the Sharpe ratio or the risk-free rate when evaluating investment performance in a more comprehensive manner. These measures help assess returns relative to the level of risk taken.

13. **Profit_margin_growth_rate:** The "profit margin growth rate" is a financial metric that measures the rate at which a company's profit margins are changing or increasing over a specific period. It assesses how efficiently a company is managing its costs and generating profits.  
To calculate the profit margin growth rate, you typically compare the profit margin from one period to the profit margin from a previous period and then calculate the percentage change. The formula is as follows:  
Profit Margin Growth Rate = [(Current Period Profit Margin - Previous Period Profit Margin) / Previous Period Profit Margin] * 100  
This metric provides insight into a company's ability to improve its profitability over time. A positive profit margin growth rate suggests that the company is becoming more efficient in managing costs or increasing its revenue relative to the previous period. Conversely, a negative growth rate indicates a decline in profitability.
Investors and analysts often use the profit margin growth rate to assess a company's financial health and its ability to sustain or improve profitability in the future.

14. **Stock_market_value:** The "stock market value" refers to the total market capitalization of a publicly-traded company. It represents the total value of a company's outstanding shares of stock in the financial markets. To calculate the stock market value of a company, you multiply the current market price per share by the total number of outstanding shares.  
Mathematically, Stock Market Value = Current Market Price Per Share × Total Number of Outstanding Shares
This metric is important for investors, analysts, and stakeholders because it provides an estimate of the company's overall worth as perceived by the stock market. It can also be used to compare the relative size of different companies in the stock market and is often used as a key indicator in financial analysis and investment decision-making.

15. **Net_profit_to_sale:** The "Net Profit to Sales" ratio, often referred to as the "Net Profit Margin," is a financial metric that assesses the profitability of a company's operations by measuring the percentage of its total sales revenue that remains as net profit (or net income) after accounting for all expenses, including operating expenses, interest, taxes, and other costs.  
The formula to calculate the Net Profit Margin is as follows:  
Net Profit Margin = (Net Profit / Total Sales) * 100  
In this formula:  
Net Profit, also known as net income or net earnings, represents the profit remaining after all expenses have been deducted from total sales or revenue.  
Total Sales, often referred to as revenue, represents the total income generated from the company's primary business operations.  
The Net Profit Margin is expressed as a percentage and provides a comprehensive view of a company's profitability. It takes into account all income and expenses, including non-operating items and taxes, to assess how effectively a company generates profit from its operations. A higher net profit margin indicates that the company is efficient in managing its expenses and generating profit for each dollar of sales revenue.
Investors, analysts, and business managers use the Net Profit Margin to assess a company's overall financial health, profitability, and ability to generate returns for shareholders. A healthy and consistent net profit margin is generally considered a positive indicator of a company's financial performance. Comparing the net profit margin to industry benchmarks and historical values can help stakeholders evaluate the company's competitive position and financial stability.

16. **Net_profit_to_Gross_profit:** The "Net Profit to Gross Profit" ratio is a financial metric that measures the portion of a company's gross profit that remains as net profit (or net income) after accounting for all operating and non-operating expenses, including interest, taxes, and other costs. This ratio assesses the efficiency of a company in managing its operating expenses and generating profit from its core business operations. The formula to calculate the Net Profit to Gross Profit ratio is as follows:  
Net Profit to Gross Profit Ratio = (Net Profit / Gross Profit) * 100  
In this formula:  
Gross Profit represents the profit remaining after deducting the direct costs associated with producing or purchasing the goods or services that were sold during a specific period. It includes expenses such as raw materials, labor, manufacturing costs, and other directly related costs.  
Net Profit, also known as net income or net earnings, represents the profit remaining after all expenses, including operating expenses, interest expenses, taxes, and other costs, have been deducted from total sales or revenue.  
The Net Profit to Gross Profit ratio is expressed as a percentage and provides insight into how effectively a company manages its operating expenses to generate net profit from its core business activities. A higher ratio indicates that the company is efficient in controlling its operating expenses and retaining a larger proportion of gross profit as net profit. Investors, analysts, and business managers use this metric to assess a company's profitability and operational efficiency. It helps evaluate how well the company converts its gross profit into net profit, considering all income and expenses. A higher ratio is generally considered favorable, as it suggests stronger profitability and efficient cost management.

17. **Current_ratio:** The "Current Ratio" is a financial ratio that measures a company's short-term liquidity and its ability to cover its short-term obligations using its current assets. It's an important indicator of a company's financial health and its capacity to meet its immediate financial needs.<br><br>
The formula to calculate the Current Ratio is as follows:<br><br>
Current Ratio = Current Assets / Current Liabilities<br><br>
In this formula:<br><br>
Current Assets represent assets that are expected to be converted into cash or used up within one year or one operating cycle, whichever is longer. Typical current assets include cash, accounts receivable, inventory, and short-term investments.<br><br>
Current Liabilities represent the company's short-term financial obligations that are due within one year or one operating cycle. These liabilities may include accounts payable, short-term debt, and other short-term obligations.<br><br>
The Current Ratio provides a numerical representation of the company's ability to cover its short-term debts using its short-term assets. A Current Ratio greater than 1 indicates that the company has more current assets than current liabilities, which is generally considered a positive sign of liquidity and the ability to meet short-term obligations<br><br>
However, it's important to note that an excessively high Current Ratio may suggest that a company is not efficiently utilizing its assets and may have too much capital tied up in non-productive assets. Therefore, while a Current Ratio greater than 1 is generally desired, the optimal ratio can vary depending on the industry and the company's specific circumstances.<br><br>
Investors, creditors, and financial analysts use the Current Ratio to assess a company's liquidity and short-term financial health. It is often compared to industry averages and historical values to evaluate changes in a company's financial position over time.  

18. **Net_working_capital:** Net Working Capital, often abbreviated as NWC, is a financial metric that measures the difference between a company's current assets and its current liabilities. It provides insight into a company's short-term liquidity and its ability to cover its short-term financial obligations using its short-term assets. Net Working Capital is a fundamental component of a company's financial health and stability.<br><br>
The formula to calculate Net Working Capital is as follows:<br><br>
Net Working Capital = Current Assets - Current Liabilities<br><br>
In this formula:<br><br>
Current Assets are assets that are expected to be converted into cash or used up within one year or one operating cycle, whichever is longer. Typical current assets include cash, accounts receivable, inventory, and short-term investments.<br>
Current Liabilities are the company's short-term financial obligations that are due within one year or one operating cycle. These liabilities may include accounts payable, short-term debt, and other short-term obligations.<br>
The resulting Net Working Capital figure can be either positive or negative:<br>
A Positive Net Working Capital indicates that a company has more current assets than current liabilities. This suggests that the company has a cushion of liquidity to cover its short-term financial obligations.<br>
A Negative Net Working Capital indicates that a company's current liabilities exceed its current assets. This may indicate a potential liquidity problem, as the company may struggle to meet its short-term obligations with its current resources.<br>
Net Working Capital is a crucial metric for assessing a company's ability to manage its short-term financial needs and its overall financial health. It is used by investors, creditors, and financial analysts to evaluate the company's liquidity position and its capacity to withstand financial challenges. A positive Net Working Capital is generally preferred, but the optimal amount can vary depending on the industry and the company's specific circumstances.

19. **Operating_assets_Ratio:**  

20. **Total_asset_turnover:** The "Total Asset Turnover" ratio is a financial metric that measures a company's efficiency in utilizing its total assets to generate sales revenue. It assesses how effectively a company is using its assets to generate income from its primary operations.<br>
The formula to calculate the Total Asset Turnover ratio is as follows:<br><br>
Total Asset Turnover = Total Sales (or Revenue) / Average Total Assets<br><br>
In this formula:<br>
Total Sales (or Revenue) represents the total income generated from a company's primary business operations.<br>
Average Total Assets represent the average total assets that the company had at its disposal during a specific period. This is often calculated as the average of the beginning and ending total asset values for the period.<br>
The Total Asset Turnover ratio indicates how efficiently a company converts its assets into sales revenue. A higher ratio typically suggests better asset utilization, as it means the company generates more sales revenue for each dollar invested in total assets. Conversely, a lower ratio may indicate that the company is less efficient in using its assets to generate revenue.<br>
Investors, analysts, and business managers use the Total Asset Turnover ratio to assess a company's operational efficiency and its ability to maximize sales from its asset base. It is particularly useful for comparing a company's performance to industry peers and for tracking changes in asset utilization over time. Different industries may have varying norms for this ratio due to differences in business models and asset requirements.

21. **DPS:** "DPS" is an acronym that stands for "Dividends Per Share." It is a financial metric used to measure the amount of dividends a company pays to its shareholders on a per-share basis. Dividends are typically paid by companies to distribute a portion of their profits to shareholders as a reward for holding their shares.<br>
The formula to calculate Dividends Per Share (DPS) is as follows:<br><br>
DPS = Total Dividends Paid / Number of Outstanding Shares<br><br>
In this formula:<br>
Total Dividends Paid represents the total amount of dividends that the company has distributed to its shareholders over a specific period.<br>
Number of Outstanding Shares is the total number of shares that are owned by shareholders and are eligible to receive dividends.<br>
Dividends Per Share is expressed in the same currency as the company's dividend payments (e.g., dollars, euros, etc.) and is often reported on financial statements and in investor communications.<br>
DPS is an important metric for investors, especially those who seek income from their investments, such as dividend-focused investors. It provides insight into the dividend payout policy of a company and allows investors to assess the dividend income they can expect to receive for each share they own. Comparing the DPS of different companies can also help investors evaluate investment opportunities and make informed decisions regarding income-oriented investments.

22. **EPS_growth:** "EPS Growth" stands for "Earnings Per Share Growth," and it is a financial metric that measures the percentage increase or decrease in a company's earnings per share (EPS) over a specific period. EPS is a fundamental measure of a company's profitability and is calculated by dividing the net income (profit) attributable to common shareholders by the total number of outstanding shares.<br>
The formula to calculate EPS Growth is as follows:<br><br>
EPS Growth = [(Current EPS - Previous EPS) / |Previous EPS|] * 100<br><br>
In this formula:<br>
Current EPS represents the earnings per share for the most recent period being analyzed.<br>
Previous EPS represents the earnings per share for the period immediately preceding the current period.<br>
The EPS Growth percentage indicates how much a company's earnings per share have increased or decreased compared to the previous period. A positive EPS Growth percentage suggests that earnings have grown, while a negative percentage indicates a decline in earnings per share.<br>
Investors and analysts use EPS Growth as an important indicator of a company's financial performance and growth prospects. A consistent and positive EPS Growth is often considered a positive sign, as it indicates that the company is generating more profit per share, which can lead to an increase in shareholder value. However, it's essential to consider the broader financial context and industry benchmarks when interpreting EPS Growth, as different industries and economic cycles can influence growth rates. Additionally, understanding the reasons behind the EPS growth or decline is crucial for a more comprehensive assessment of a company's financial health.

23. **Liquidity_ratios:** Liquidity ratios are financial metrics that assess a company's ability to meet its short-term financial obligations and convert its assets into cash quickly. These ratios provide insights into a company's short-term financial health and its capacity to cover immediate liabilities.<br><br>
Liquidity ratios are essential for assessing a company's ability to manage its short-term cash flow and financial stability. They are used by investors, creditors, and financial analysts to evaluate the risk associated with a company's short-term financial position. Different industries may have varying norms for these ratios, and what is considered a healthy liquidity ratio can depend on the specific circumstances of the company.<br><br>
While high liquidity ratios indicate a strong ability to meet short-term obligations, excessively high ratios may suggest underutilized assets. Therefore, it's crucial to analyze liquidity ratios in conjunction with other financial metrics and consider industry benchmarks when evaluating a company's financial health.

24. **ROA:** "ROA" stands for "Return on Assets," and it is a financial ratio that measures a company's profitability relative to its total assets. ROA is a key indicator of how efficiently a company utilizes its assets to generate profit.<br>
The formula to calculate Return on Assets (ROA) is as follows:<br><br>
ROA = (Net Profit / Total Assets) * 100<br><br>
In this formula:<br>
Net Profit represents the profit remaining after all expenses, including operating expenses, interest expenses, taxes, and other costs, have been deducted from total revenue or sales.<br>
Total Assets represent the company's total holdings, including cash, accounts receivable, inventory, property, plant, equipment, and other assets.<br>
ROA is expressed as a percentage and provides insight into the company's ability to generate profit from its asset base. A higher ROA indicates that the company is using its assets efficiently to generate profit, while a lower ROA suggests that the company may not be utilizing its assets as effectively.<br>
ROA is a valuable metric for assessing a company's overall financial performance and comparing it to industry peers. It is often used by investors, analysts, and financial institutions to evaluate a company's ability to generate returns for its shareholders and to assess management's efficiency in asset management. Keep in mind that the ideal ROA can vary by industry, and it's important to consider industry norms and benchmarks when interpreting this ratio.

25. **Quick_Ratio:** The "Quick Ratio," also known as the "Acid-Test Ratio," is a financial ratio that measures a company's short-term liquidity and its ability to meet its immediate financial obligations without relying on the sale of inventory. It provides a more conservative measure of liquidity compared to the Current Ratio because it excludes inventory from current assets.<br>
The formula to calculate the Quick Ratio is as follows:<br><br>
Quick Ratio = (Current Assets - Inventory) / Current Liabilities<br><br>
In this formula:<br>
- Current Assets represent assets that are expected to be converted into cash or used up within one year or one operating cycle, whichever is longer. Common current assets include cash, accounts receivable, and short-term investments.
- Inventory represents the value of goods held by the company for the purpose of resale.
- Current Liabilities are the company's short-term financial obligations that are due within one year or one operating cycle. These liabilities may include accounts payable, short-term debt, and other short-term obligations.<br><br>
The Quick Ratio is expressed as a numerical ratio and provides insight into a company's ability to cover its immediate financial obligations using its most liquid assets (assets that can be quickly converted into cash). A Quick Ratio greater than 1 indicates that the company can cover its short-term liabilities without relying on the sale of inventory. It is often considered a more stringent test of liquidity than the Current Ratio.<br>
The Quick Ratio is essential for assessing a company's ability to meet its short-term obligations during periods of financial stress or when inventory may not be easily sold. It is used by investors, creditors, and financial analysts to evaluate a company's liquidity position and its capacity to withstand financial challenges. Different industries may have varying norms for the Quick Ratio, and it's important to consider industry benchmarks when interpreting this metric.

26. **Average_payment_period:** The "Average Payment Period" is a financial metric that measures the average number of days it takes for a company to pay its suppliers or vendors after purchasing goods or services from them. It is also sometimes referred to as the "Days Payable Outstanding" or "DPO."<br>
The formula to calculate the Average Payment Period is as follows:<br><br>
Average Payment Period = (Accounts Payable / Cost of Goods Sold) * Number of Days in the Period<br><br>
In this formula:<br>
- Accounts Payable represents the amount of money a company owes to its suppliers or vendors for goods or services received but not yet paid for. It is a liability on the company's balance sheet.
- Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) represents the total cost incurred by the company to produce or purchase the goods that were sold during a specific period.
- The Number of Days in the Period refers to the time frame for which you want to calculate the average payment period (e.g., a quarter or a year).<br><br>
The Average Payment Period is expressed in days and provides insights into how efficiently a company manages its accounts payable. A longer average payment period suggests that the company takes more time to pay its suppliers, potentially indicating an advantageous working capital position. However, excessively long payment periods can strain supplier relationships. Conversely, a shorter average payment period may indicate a company's commitment to prompt payments but could also reflect tighter liquidity.<br>
Companies and analysts use the Average Payment Period to assess a company's working capital management, cash flow management, and supplier relationships. It's important to compare this metric to industry norms and consider the company's specific industry and business model when interpreting the results.

27. **ROE:** "ROE" stands for "Return on Equity," and it is a financial ratio that measures a company's profitability relative to its shareholders' equity. ROE is a key performance indicator that assesses how effectively a company generates profit from shareholders' investments.<br>
The formula to calculate Return on Equity (ROE) is as follows:<br><br>
ROE = (Net Profit / Shareholders' Equity) * 100<br><br>
In this formula:<br>
- Net Profit represents the profit remaining after all expenses, including operating expenses, interest expenses, taxes, and other costs, have been deducted from total revenue or sales.
- Shareholders' Equity, also known as shareholders' funds or book value, represents the total value of the shareholders' ownership in the company. It is calculated as the difference between total assets and total liabilities and represents the residual interest in the company's assets after deducting all debts and obligations.<br><br>
ROE is expressed as a percentage and provides insight into the company's ability to generate returns for its shareholders based on their invested capital. A higher ROE indicates that the company is effectively using shareholders' equity to generate profit, while a lower ROE suggests less efficient utilization of shareholders' capital.<br>
ROE is a critical metric for investors, analysts, and financial institutions when evaluating a company's financial performance and profitability. It is often used for comparing a company's performance to industry peers and for assessing management's effectiveness in generating returns for shareholders. The optimal ROE can vary by industry, and it's essential to consider industry benchmarks and the company's specific circumstances when interpreting this ratio.

28. **EPS:** "EPS" stands for "Earnings Per Share," and it is a fundamental financial metric used to measure a company's profitability on a per-share basis. EPS provides information on how much profit a company generates for each outstanding share of its common stock.<br>
The formula to calculate Earnings Per Share (EPS) is as follows:<br><br>
EPS = (Net Profit / Number of Outstanding Shares)<br><br>
In this formula:<br>
Net Profit represents the company's total earnings or profit after all expenses, including operating expenses, interest expenses, taxes, and other costs, have been deducted.<br>
Number of Outstanding Shares represents the total number of shares of the company's common stock that are owned by shareholders and are eligible to receive a portion of the company's earnings.<br>
EPS is expressed as a numerical value, often in the currency of the company's financial statements (e.g., dollars, euros). It is a critical metric for investors and analysts, as it helps assess a company's financial performance and profitability on a per-share basis.

29. **Total_income_growth:** "Total Income Growth" refers to the percentage increase or decrease in a company's total income over a specific period compared to the income from a previous period. Total income includes all sources of revenue or income that a company generates from its primary operations, investments, and other activities.<br>
The formula to calculate Total Income Growth is as follows:<br><br>
Total Income Growth = [(Current Total Income - Previous Total Income) / |Previous Total Income|] * 100<br><br>
In this formula:
- Current Total Income represents the total income or revenue generated by the company during the most recent period being analyzed.
- Previous Total Income represents the total income or revenue generated by the company during the period immediately preceding the current period.<br><br>
Total Income Growth is expressed as a percentage and provides insights into how a company's overall income has changed over time. A positive growth percentage indicates an increase in total income, while a negative percentage indicates a decrease.<br>
Total Income Growth is a useful metric for assessing a company's financial performance and its ability to increase its income over time. It can be particularly important for investors and analysts when evaluating a company's growth prospects and financial stability. However, it's essential to consider the reasons behind the income growth or decline and to analyze it in conjunction with other financial metrics and factors affecting the company and its industry.

30. **P_to_E:** P/E stands for "Price-to-Earnings" ratio. It is a commonly used financial metric that helps investors and analysts assess the valuation of a publicly-traded company's stock. The P/E ratio is calculated by dividing the current market price per share of the company's stock by its earnings per share (EPS). The formula is as follows:<br><br>
P/E Ratio = Current Market Price per Share / Earnings per Share (EPS)<br><br>
In this formula:
- Current Market Price per Share is the current trading price of one share of the company's stock in the stock market.
- Earnings per Share (EPS) represents the company's net income (profit) divided by the total number of outstanding shares of its stock.<br><br>
The P/E ratio is a valuable tool for investors because it provides insight into how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings generated by the company. A high P/E ratio may suggest that investors have high expectations for future earnings growth, while a low P/E ratio may indicate that the stock is relatively undervalued.<br>
However, it's essential to consider other factors and industry comparisons when interpreting the P/E ratio, as it can vary significantly between different sectors and companies. Additionally, a high P/E ratio does not necessarily mean a stock is overvalued, and a low P/E ratio does not guarantee that a stock is a good investment.

31. **ROI:** ROI stands for "Return on Investment." It is a financial metric used to evaluate the profitability or performance of an investment relative to its cost. ROI is typically expressed as a percentage and is calculated using the following formula:<br><br>
ROI = [(Net Profit from Investment / Cost of Investment) * 100]<br><br>
In this formula:
- Net Profit from Investment refers to the gain or income generated from the investment, which includes any revenue, dividends, interest, or capital appreciation.
- Cost of Investment represents the initial or total cost of acquiring the investment, including purchase price, fees, and other associated expenses.<br><br>
ROI is a widely used metric in finance and business because it provides a clear way to assess the effectiveness of an investment. A positive ROI indicates that the investment has generated more profit than its cost, while a negative ROI suggests a loss. Investors and businesses use ROI to make decisions about allocating capital and resources to various investment opportunities, projects, or initiatives. It helps them prioritize investments that offer the highest potential for returns.

32. **Capital:** Company's outstanding shares of stock multiple 1,000 Iranian Rials (IRR). In Iran financial Market, It is calculated by multiplying the total outstanding shares of stock to 1,000 IRR (Nominal price per share). 

33. **P_to_B:** P/B stands for "Price-to-Book" ratio. It is a financial metric used by investors and analysts to assess the valuation of a publicly-traded company's stock relative to its book value. The P/B ratio is calculated by dividing the current market price per share of the company's stock by its book value per share. The formula is as follows:<br><br>
P/B Ratio = Current Market Price per Share / Book Value per Share<br><br>
In this formula:
- Current Market Price per Share is the current trading price of one share of the company's stock in the stock market.
- Book Value per Share represents the company's total shareholders' equity (assets minus liabilities) divided by the total number of outstanding shares of its stock.<br><br>
The P/B ratio provides insight into how the market values a company's assets and equity. A high P/B ratio may suggest that investors are willing to pay a premium for the company's assets, possibly indicating expectations of future growth. Conversely, a low P/B ratio may indicate that the stock is undervalued relative to its book value, which could make it an attractive investment opportunity.<br><br>
However, it's important to consider that the P/B ratio may not be the sole indicator of a company's investment attractiveness. Factors such as the company's growth prospects, industry conditions, and earnings potential should also be taken into account when making investment decisions. Additionally, P/B ratios can vary significantly among different industries and types of companies, so it's often more meaningful when used in comparison with industry peers or historical values.

34. **P_to_S:** P/S stands for "Price-to-Sales" ratio. It is a financial metric used by investors and analysts to assess the valuation of a publicly-traded company's stock relative to its revenue or sales. The P/S ratio is calculated by dividing the current market price per share of the company's stock by its revenue or sales per share. The formula is as follows:<br><br>
P/S Ratio = Current Market Price per Share / Sales per Share<br><br>
In this formula:
- Current Market Price per Share is the current trading price of one share of the company's stock in the stock market.
- Sales per Share represents the company's total revenue or sales divided by the total number of outstanding shares of its stock.<br><br>
The P/S ratio provides insight into how the market values a company's sales. It can be particularly useful when evaluating companies that may not yet be profitable or have inconsistent earnings. A low P/S ratio may indicate that the stock is undervalued relative to its sales, which could make it an attractive investment opportunity. Conversely, a high P/S ratio may suggest that the stock is trading at a premium based on its sales, possibly due to high growth expectations.<br><br>
As with other valuation ratios, it's important to consider the P/S ratio in conjunction with other factors, such as the company's growth prospects, industry conditions, and profitability. Additionally, P/S ratios can vary widely among different industries, so it's often more meaningful when used in comparison with industry peers or historical values.

35. **Cash_to_total_assets_ratio:** The "Cash to Total Assets Ratio" is a financial metric that assesses the proportion of a company's total assets that are held in the form of cash or cash equivalents. It is calculated by dividing the total cash and cash equivalents by the total assets of the company. The formula is as follows:<br><br>
Cash to Total Assets Ratio = (Total Cash and Cash Equivalents) / (Total Assets)<br><br>
In this formula:
- Total Cash and Cash Equivalents represents the sum of cash on hand and assets that are highly liquid and can be converted to cash quickly, such as short-term investments or marketable securities.
- Total Assets refers to the company's total holdings, including cash, accounts receivable, inventory, property, plant, equipment, and other assets.<br><br>
The Cash to Total Assets Ratio provides insight into a company's liquidity and its ability to cover its short-term obligations. A higher ratio suggests that a larger portion of a company's assets is held in cash or readily convertible assets, which can be beneficial for meeting immediate financial needs. Conversely, a lower ratio may indicate that the company has less liquidity and relies more on non-cash assets to generate value.<br><br>
This ratio is important for assessing a company's financial health and its ability to handle unexpected expenses or economic downturns. However, a very high cash-to-total-assets ratio may also indicate that the company is not efficiently deploying its resources to generate returns, as cash typically earns minimal interest or returns compared to other investments. Therefore, a balance between liquidity and asset utilization is typically sought after. 

36. **Debt_to_equity_ratio:** The "Debt-to-Equity Ratio" is a financial metric that assesses a company's financial leverage or capital structure by comparing its total debt to its shareholders' equity. It is calculated by dividing the total debt of the company by its total equity. The formula is as follows:<br><br>
Debt-to-Equity Ratio = Total Debt / Shareholders' Equity<br><br>
In this formula:
- Total Debt represents all of a company's outstanding debt, including long-term and short-term loans, bonds, and other borrowings.
- Shareholders' Equity, also known as stockholders' equity or owners' equity, is the residual interest in the assets of the company after deducting its liabilities. It includes common stock, retained earnings, and additional paid-in capital.<br><br>
The Debt-to-Equity Ratio provides insight into how a company finances its operations and growth. A high ratio suggests that the company relies more on debt financing, which can increase financial risk due to interest payments and repayment obligations. On the other hand, a low ratio indicates a lower reliance on debt and a potentially more conservative financial structure.<br><br>
Investors and creditors use the Debt-to-Equity Ratio to assess a company's financial health and risk profile. A high ratio may indicate a higher level of financial risk, while a lower ratio may suggest a lower level of risk but may also imply a lower return on equity. The optimal level of debt-to-equity ratio can vary by industry and company, and it's important to consider the industry norm and the company's specific circumstances when interpreting this ratio.

37. **Equity_Ratio:** The "Equity Ratio," also known as the "Equity-to-Asset Ratio" or "Equity Ratio," is a financial metric that assesses the proportion of a company's total assets that are financed by shareholders' equity. It is calculated by dividing the total shareholders' equity by the total assets of the company. The formula is as follows:<br><br>
Equity Ratio = Total Shareholders' Equity / Total Assets<br><br>
In this formula:
- Total Shareholders' Equity represents the residual interest in the assets of the company after deducting its liabilities. It includes common stock, retained earnings, and additional paid-in capital.
- Total Assets refers to the company's total holdings, including cash, accounts receivable, inventory, property, plant, equipment, and other assets.<br><br>
The Equity Ratio provides insight into the extent to which a company's operations and assets are financed by its owners (shareholders) rather than external sources of funding, such as debt. A higher equity ratio indicates that a larger portion of the company's assets is funded by equity, which can suggest a more conservative and financially stable capital structure.<br><br>
Investors and creditors often use the Equity Ratio to assess a company's financial risk and solvency. A higher equity ratio is generally seen as favorable because it indicates a lower level of financial leverage (reliance on debt) and a greater ability to withstand financial challenges. However, it's essential to consider industry norms and the company's specific circumstances when interpreting this ratio, as optimal equity ratios can vary by industry and company.

38. **DuPont_Ratio:** The "DuPont Analysis" or "DuPont Ratio" is a financial performance measurement framework that breaks down the return on equity (ROE) of a company into various components to provide a deeper understanding of what's driving a company's profitability and how it's utilizing its assets and equity. The DuPont Analysis is named after the DuPont Corporation, which pioneered this method in the early 20th century.<br><br>
The DuPont Analysis decomposes ROE into three key components:<br><br>
- **Profit Margin**: This component measures the company's ability to generate profit from its sales. It is calculated as Net Income divided by Revenue (Sales).<br><br>
Profit Margin = Net Income / Revenue<br><br>
- **Asset Turnover**: This component evaluates how efficiently the company utilizes its assets to generate sales. It is calculated as Revenue divided by Average Total Assets.<br><br>
   Asset Turnover = Revenue / Average Total Assets<br><br>
- **Financial Leverage**: This component assesses the impact of financial leverage or debt on ROE. It is calculated as Average Total Assets divided by Average Shareholders' Equity.<br><br>
   Financial Leverage = Average Total Assets / Average Shareholders' Equity<br><br>
   The DuPont Analysis formula combines these components to calculate ROE as follows:<br><br>
   ROE = Profit Margin × Asset Turnover × Financial Leverage<br><br>
   By breaking ROE into these components, the DuPont Analysis helps analysts and investors identify specific areas of strength or weakness in a company's financial performance. For example, a high ROE may be driven by a high profit margin or efficient asset turnover, or it could be due to the use of financial leverage. Conversely, a low ROE may be caused by weaknesses in one or more of these components.<br><br>
   This analytical tool provides a more comprehensive view of a company's financial health and helps stakeholders make informed decisions about investment, financial strategy, and performance improvement.

39. **Gross_profit_margin:** The "Gross Profit Margin" is a financial metric that measures the profitability of a company's core operating activities by assessing the percentage of revenue (or sales) that remains after deducting the cost of goods sold (COGS). It is an important indicator of a company's ability to produce goods or services profitably. The formula to calculate the Gross Profit Margin is as follows:<br><br>
Gross Profit Margin = [(Revenue - Cost of Goods Sold) / Revenue] × 100<br><br>
